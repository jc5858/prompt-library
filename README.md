# PromptVault - Your Personal Prompt Library

PromptVault is a simple, browser-based prompt management system that helps you organize, store, and reuse your AI prompts. Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it's easy to deploy on GitHub Pages.

## Features

- Create, edit, and delete prompts
- Tag-based organization system
- Favorite prompts for quick access
- Search functionality to find prompts quickly
- Sort prompts by date, alphabetically, or usage
- Copy prompts to clipboard with one click

## Getting Started

1. Visit the live site at: [YOUR_GITHUB_PAGES_URL]
2. Click the "+" button to create your first prompt
3. Add a title, content, and tags
4. Save and organize your prompts

## Local Storage

PromptVault uses your browser's localStorage to save prompts. This means:
- Your prompts are saved between sessions
- Prompts are only available on the device/browser you created them on
- Clearing browser data will remove your prompts

Consider exporting your prompts regularly if you have valuable content.
